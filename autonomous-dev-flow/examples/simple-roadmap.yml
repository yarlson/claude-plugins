  linting: "ruff"
  goal: "Build a calculator library with basic arithmetic operations"

phases:
  - id: 0
    name: "Project Setup"
    goal: "Set up project structure and testing framework"
    success:
      - "Directory structure created (src/, tests/)"
      - "pytest installed and configured"
      - "Basic project files created (README, setup.py)"
      - "Can run tests successfully"

  - id: 1
    name: "Addition and Subtraction"
    goal: "Implement basic arithmetic with add() and subtract() methods"
    success:
      - "Calculator class exists"
      - "add(a, b) method works for integers and floats"
      - "subtract(a, b) method works correctly"
      - "Edge cases tested (negatives, zero, large numbers)"
      - "100% test coverage"

  - id: 2
    name: "Multiplication and Division"
    goal: "Add multiply() and divide() with proper error handling"
    success:
      - "multiply(a, b) method works correctly"
      - "divide(a, b) method works correctly"
      - "Division by zero raises ZeroDivisionError"
      - "All edge cases tested"
      - "Clear error messages"

  - id: 3
    name: "Advanced Operations"
    goal: "Add power(), sqrt(), and modulo() operations"
    success:
      - "power(base, exponent) method works"
      - "sqrt(n) method works"
      - "modulo(a, b) method works"
      - "Input validation prevents invalid operations"
      - "All methods thoroughly tested"

  - id: 4
    name: "Expression Evaluator"
    goal: "Evaluate string expressions with proper operator precedence"
    success:
      - "evaluate(expression) method works"
      - "Operator precedence correct (* / before + -)"
      - "Parentheses supported"
      - "Invalid expressions raise clear errors"
      - "Complex expressions tested"

  - id: 5
    name: "Command-Line Interface"
    goal: "Create interactive CLI for calculator usage"
    success:
      - "Interactive REPL mode works"
      - "Command-line argument mode works"
      - "History feature shows previous calculations"
      - "Help command available"
      - "Clean exit handling (Ctrl+C)"

  - id: 6
    name: "Documentation and Packaging"
    goal: "Complete documentation and PyPI packaging"
    success:
      - "README with installation and usage examples"
      - "API documentation for all methods"
      - "Usage examples in examples/ directory"
