# Roadmap Template for Autonomous Development
# Complete this template and execute with: /autonomous-dev path/to/roadmap.yml

proj:
  name: "Your Project Name"
  lang: "Python" # Python|Go|Rust|TypeScript|Java
  test: "pytest tests/ -v" # Test command
  lint: "ruff check ." # Lint command
  goal: "One-sentence project objective"

phases:
  # Phase 0: Foundation (structure, basic utilities)
  - id: 0
    name: "Foundation"
    goal: "Create project structure and basic utilities"
    success:
      - "Directory structure exists"
      - "Basic utilities work"
      - "Tests pass"

  # Phase 1: Core Feature (main functionality)
  - id: 1
    name: "Core Feature"
    goal: "Implement main feature logic"
    success:
      - "Core component works"
      - "Feature handles basic cases"
      - "Tests pass"

  # Phase 2: Extension (additional features)
  - id: 2
    name: "Extension"
    goal: "Add extended functionality"
    success:
      - "Extended features work"
      - "Integrates with core"
      - "Tests pass"

  # Phase 3: Integration (CLI, API, etc.)
  - id: 3
    name: "Integration"
    goal: "Create user-facing interface"
    success:
      - "Interface works end-to-end"
      - "Error handling complete"
      - "Tests pass"

# Tips:
# - Each phase: 2-8 hours of work
# - Success criteria: specific and measurable
# - Sequence: foundation → core → extension → integration
# - Keep phases focused (single responsibility)
