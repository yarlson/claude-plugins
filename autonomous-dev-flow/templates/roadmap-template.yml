      - "[Specific outcome 2]"
      - "[Specific outcome 3]"
      - "Integration with Phase 0 working"

    success:
      - "[Specific outcome 1]"
      - "[Specific outcome 2]"

  # Phase N: Documentation/Polish (typically final phase)

# Template Usage Instructions:
# 1. Replace all [placeholders] with actual content
# 2. Keep phases sequential (0, 1, 2, ...)
# 3. Each phase should build on previous phases
# 4. Success criteria should be specific and measurable
# 5. Each phase should be achievable in 2-8 hours
# 6. Remove these instructions before using

# Example success criteria:
# Good: "Calculator.add() method works for positive and negative numbers"
# Bad: "Calculator works"
#
# Good: "Parser handles expressions with parentheses correctly"
# Bad: "Add parser"
